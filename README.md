# Supervised Learning and Data Challenge  
**November 2024**

## Project Overview  
This project applies supervised learning techniques to tackle two distinct machine learning challenges: a **regression** problem and a **multiclass classification** problem. The work is part of the **Advanced Supervised Learning and Data Challenge** within the **second year** of the Master of Mathematics and AI program at **Paris-Saclay University**.

### 1. **Regression Problem**  
Our objective was to predict the value of **taxi tips** in **New York City**, a regression task where the target variable is continuous.
1. **Continuous Regression Problem**: 

### 2. **Multiclass Classification Problem**  
The aim was to predict different **cover types**, a classification task where the target variable has multiple categories.

We tackled each problem independently as follows:

- **Data Analysis**: We began by analyzing the dataset to identify significant variables and made necessary modifications to obtain an optimal dataset for model training.
- **Model Training**: We trained three models on the prepared data.
- **Results and Perspectives**: Finally, we discussed the results and provided perspectives for potential improvements.

- ## Methodology  
The methodology for both tasks involves:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and splitting datasets into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**: Using a variety of supervised learning algorithms.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics such as **R squared** for regression, and **F1-score** for classification tasks.
- **Optimization**: Tuning hyperparameters using techniques such as **Grid Search** and **Cross-validation**.

Detailed explanations of the methodology, code implementation, and results can be found in the project **report** located within this repository.
